  <Description>These snails are shell fish, like mussels or clams.

There are several ways to prepare this.  You can buy special dishes which look like miniature glass muffin pans in which you can cook snails individually, six at a time.  You can use regular muffin pans and cook servings of 4-6 snails in each section.  You can cook them en masse in an earthenware vessel.  The trick is to make sure they aren't packed tightly together, and that they are about 1/2 submerged in butter.  The 'French way' involves using the snail's shell as the cooking and serving vessel.
