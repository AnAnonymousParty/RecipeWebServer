  <Description>Tomatoes. 

What are they? Nobody knows.

Are they a fruit? Yes, botanically.
Are they a vegetable? Yes, commercially.

Are they poisonous? The fruit, no. The plant, slightly.

Are they good to eat? When they are in season and fresh, they can be exquisite. Out of season, strip-mined in Texas and processed through some DuPont facility, they are insipid.
