  <Method>
    <Step image="">Remove the meat from the bag (reserving the little spice packet) and pat dry.</Step>
    <Step image="">Put some oil (~2 tblsp) into a skillet and place it on high heat.  As the oil reaches its smoke point, lay the brisket in and start browning it.  The idea is to get it well browned (caramelized) on all surfaces, so you will have to move it around, press it into the oil, stand it on its edges. </Step>
    <Step image="">Now you need a cooking vessel, with a cover, large enough so all the brisket can lay flat.  Put the cabbage and onions in the pan, the contents of the little spice packet and then the meat.</Step>
    <Step image="">Pour stock over the meat to no more than half the depth of the meat.</Step>
    <Step image="">Put the pan on to simmer (or in the oven at about 275) for an hour or so. </Step>
    <Step image="">Check the pan occasionally to ensure the liquid never boils or runs dry of liquid, add more stock as necessary.  The cooking should be a very slow simmer, never a boil, this is especially important for corned beef -boiling it will make it tougher than tire rubber. </Step>
    <Step image="">How long you cook it now depends on how much time you have.  I like to get in at least four hours.  Six is better. </Step>
    <Step image="">After the cooking is done, remove the meat (carefully, as it will be falling apart) and hold it in a covered vessel to keep it warm. Strain the cooking liquid through a chinois and then thoroughly degrease it. </Step>
    <Step image="">Strain the liquid again through a paper towel lined chinois into a sauce pan.  Bring the liquid to boil, reduce it by half to make a sauce.</Step>
    <Step image="">Season the sauce with salt to taste.  Pour the sauce over the meat, garnish with chopped parsley. </Step>
