  <Method>
    <Step image="">In a large bowl, mix water, brown sugar and the prepared yeast.</Step>
    <Step image="Pretzels_Pretzels1.JPG">Stir in flour gradually, a cup at a time.  You have enough flour when the dough no longer sticks to the bowl.</Step>
    <Step image="Pretzels_Pretzels2.JPG">Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead lightly, just long enough to produce a smooth ball of dough.</Step>
    <Step image="Pretzels_Pretzels3.JPG">To form pretzels, pinch off a piece of dough about the size of a golf ball.  Roll it between your hands into a cigar shape.  Keep rolling it into a long (8-10 inch) thin tube, either with your hands or on a counter top.  You can either leave them straight or twist them into the typical pretzel shape (twist the dough into a loop using a single twist, then fold the loop over the twist and drape it over the loose ends -you know, a pretzel), or make it any shape you like. </Step>
    <Step image="Pretzels_Pretzels4.JPG">Place the pretzels onto a non-stick baking sheet.  When the sheet is full, remove them to the boiling water for 30 seconds.</Step>
    <Step image="">Transfer them back to the baking sheet and sprinkle them with as much salt as you like. </Step>
    <Step image="">Bake until golden brown, approximately 15 minutes.  Best served warm. </Step>
