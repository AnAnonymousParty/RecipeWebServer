  <Method>
    <Step image="">Spoon the stuffing into each bird, but don't pack it in tight.  Seal the stuffing in the birds (get some curved upholstery needles from Walmart and some kite string or twine) by stitching the skin
closed. </Step>
    <Step image="">Place hens, breast up, on a rack over a shallow roasting pan.  (Use one of the grates from your gas grill, cake cooler rack, etc.).  Put them in the over, reduce heat to 375 and bake for 45 minutes, until golden brown and internal temperature (breast) reaches 170 degrees.</Step>
    <Step image="">Remove from oven, let stand to rest lightly covered with foil or in microwave for 15 minutes to cool sufficiently so that internal steam can convert back to liquid and be reabsorbed by the meat and be nice and juicy and tasty at the table -unless you like dried-out and mealy poultry. 

Meanwhile...</Step>
    <Step image="">Remove fat from drippings in the bottom of roasting pan, place pan on stove over high heat and deglaze with wine. </Step>
    <Step image="">Add minced shallots and parsley, lower heat to fast simmer until sauce is reduced by half. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</Step>
    <Step image="">Just prior to serving, swirl a tbsp of butter through the sauce. </Step>
    <Step image="">Using a &lt;a href='https://www.globalcutleryusa.com/'&gt;large, very sharp knife&lt;/a&gt;, split each hen lengthwise by slicing down directly over the breastbone.  This is best done at the table so your guests can get the immediate initial whiff of the stuffing and truffle essence, don't waste that aroma to your stove's exhaust hood!  Puddle a bit of sauce onto the plate, place the hen on the sauce and garnish with sprig of fresh sage. </Step>
    <Step image="">Serve with &lt;a href='/GetRecipe?recipeName=Mashed%20Potatoes'&gt;Garlic Mashed Potatoes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href='/GetRecipe?recipeName=Prosciutto%20Wrapped%20Asparagus'&gt;Prosciutto Wrapped Asparagus&lt;/a&gt;.</Step>
