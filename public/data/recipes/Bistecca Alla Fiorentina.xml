  </Ingredients>
  <Method>
    <Step image="">In a medium bowl, add the anchovies and their oil, bacon fat, garlic, and minced rosemary. </Step>
    <Step image="">Brush the steak with a little oil from the anchovy mixture (avoid any solids at this point).</Step>
    <Step image="">Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet and raise the heat to medium-high. </Step>
    <Step image="">When the oil begins to smoke, carefully add the steak and cook, pressing down on the bone with tongs as needed to help the steak remain in contact with the skillet but otherwise not disturbing, until a very dark crust forms on the bottom, about 6 minutes. Using the tongs, flip the steak and cook until the remaining side is deeply browned, about 3 minutes. (If the steak didn't fully brown in some areas, you can baste it with some of the hot fat from the skillet: Holding the handle with a kitchen towel, tilt the skillet to pool the juices, then use a large kitchen spoon to spoon the juices over any patches that need additional browning; repeat several times.) Using the tongs, lift and turn the steak to press its fatty sides up against the surface of the skillet until browned, about 1 minute more. </Step>
    <Step image="">Transfer the steak to a cutting board and immediately brush all over with the remaining anchovy mixture.
Set aside to rest for 6 to 8 minutes. </Step>
    <Step image="">Cut the meat away from the bone and into two pieces by following the lines of the center bone. Separate both pieces slightly from the bone, reserving the bone. Starting from one end, slice each piece of meat about Â½ inch thick against the grain, keeping it in the shape of the original steak. </Step>
    <Step image="">Drizzle the meat with any remaining juices from the cutting board, serve. </Step>
