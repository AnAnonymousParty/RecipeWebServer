  <Description>&lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmesan'&gt;Parmesan&lt;/a&gt; cheese.  Real &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmesan'&gt;Parmesan&lt;/a&gt; cheese.  That stuff in the green cans ... well, it ain't cheese.  I don't know what it is.  I'm afraid that it's salted sawdust that's been soaked in milk. Real &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmesan'&gt;Parmesan&lt;/a&gt; cheese comes in hard dense wedges that you have to grind in a mouli or use a cheese grater.   Real Parmesan cheese comes from Italy.  Real Parmesan cheese has the word &lt;b&gt;Reggiano&lt;/b&gt; branded into the rind, because that's the name of the only place in which real Parmesan cheese is made.  Reggiano Parmesan is like no other Parmesan.  It is the essence of Parmesan.  The aroma is unique, owing to the sea air of the region in which it's produced.  The texture even includes little crystalized bits of &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine'&gt;tyrosine&lt;/a&gt;.  Parmesan Reggiano is called the &lt;i&gt;King of cheeses&lt;/i&gt; with good reason.  Once you have used Reggiano you will be spoiled for it for life.
